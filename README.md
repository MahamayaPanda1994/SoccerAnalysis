# Soccer Analysis: Leveraging Data for Comprehensive Innovation
If you were to inquire with any athlete or sports team globally about what motivates them, the majority would likely respond with ‘Winning’. When asked what factors would make the team win, each person had a different perspective. When we narrow down the scope of the audience to soccer, diverse opinions on the capabilities and chances of winning are being procured. Due to the large set of influencing factors, prediction is the hardest part. For many years, people believed in predictions by pundits or even an octopus in the 2010 World Cup, which is unrealistic and unreliable. One needs analysis to make a proper and even adequate prediction. This project aims to expand the range and influence of analysis by providing accessible and meaningful information to soccer fanatics to make predictions and help team management examine their strengths and shortcomings. It briefly describes our project and uses the concepts of databases, ETL, and data warehousing to process the data for analysis. We analyze all this meaningful information obtained from the database, depicting how a team approaches different matches, player impacts, etc. We aim to find key factors driving innovation in soccer regarding data analysis, ultimately enabling high-quality tactical strategies and predictions before deciding by a manager, managing company, team players, wager candidates, or even fanatics.
